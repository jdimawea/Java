Defining Terms
// Method
-modifiers, return type, method name, method body.
    -modifiers: 
        -private: Only the class in which it is declared can see and access the method. This is the most restrictive access level
        -protected: Protected access gives subclasses a chance to use the method, while preventing a nonrelated class from trying to use it.
        -public: Every class everwhere has access to the method. 

    -return type: 
        -int, String, double, boolean, or void.
    
    -method name: 
        -use lowerCamelCase. 
        -examples:
            -getValue(), setValue(), greet(), addToList();, createGreeting()

    -parameter list:
        -Whatever is enclosed in the opening and closing parenthesis are called parameters

    -method body:
        -The method body defines the instructions that are to be executed when the method is called. 
        -Code between {}
    
    -method type: 
        -static defines the method to be a class method that is invoked without reference to an object. 

    -static modifier: 
        -This modifier defines the method as a class method, which means it can be invoked without reference to a particular object.
        -Example:
            public class MathTest {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    System.out.println(Math.sin(25));
                }
            }
